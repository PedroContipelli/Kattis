Java Solutions to Kattis Problems

Profile: https://open.kattis.com/users/pedro-contipelli

Disclaimer: I wrote much of this code as a fairly beginner programmer, so it isn't all very great.

As a Java competitive programmer in high school, I struggled to find Java resources/code to help me solve
problems on Kattis, often spending months on a single problem trying to figure out a solution myself.

I hope that by posting my solutions on github, I help to fix this absence of easily accessible direct learning material
in Java (AP Computer Science A programming language) for the coming generation of programmers after me.

While I am aware there are cheaters who submit my code in order to win contests on Kattis, I hold strong in my belief
that the benefits of helping students learn outweighs any unintended side-effects or inaccurate leaderboards. Sorry!
